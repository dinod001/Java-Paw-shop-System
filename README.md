# Java-Paw-Shop-System

**Java Pet Shop System** is a **Java**-based project that utilizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts with full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations. This system allows **cashiers** and **managers** to manage pets, goods, and customer data efficiently. The system uses a **Java GUI** (Graphical User Interface) to interact with users, providing an intuitive interface. Data is stored in files for simplicity. The system features a **scalable**, **modular design**, and can easily be extended with additional features.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new pets, goods, or customers to the system.
- **Read**: View information about pets, goods, and customers.
- **Update**: Modify pet, goods, or customer details.
- **Delete**: Remove pets, goods, or customer records from the system.
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate functionalities for **cashiers** and **managers**.
- **File-Based Data Storage**: All data is stored in files rather than a database.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: The system uses **Java Swing** for a graphical user interface, making it easy to interact with the application.
- **Modular Design**: The system is designed in a scalable and modular way for easy updates and expansion.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for application logic and OOP concepts.
- **Java Swing**: For building the GUI, providing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
- **File System**: Data is stored in files instead of a traditional database for simplicity.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implements OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Java GUI**: The graphical interface is created using **Java Swing**, making the application user-friendly and interactive.
